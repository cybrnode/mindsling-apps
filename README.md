# mindsling-apps
The project is titled as "MindSling". It was supposed to be an online school platform.
On which schools will be registered along with students, their parents and teachers.
So, far the **"mindlsing-student"** app was somewhat developed. This project was cancelled as of mid November 2020.

There were 3 apps to be made for the project:

## 1 - mindsling-student
This was supposed to be the app for the students. In the app, the student was meant to
have features like joining class and parent teacher meeting, looking up their schedule and events etc.

meetings according to the schedule they were provided by the school and also arrange
parent-teacher meetings, set homework and exams for students etc.

## 3- mindsling-parent
This one was for parents. In this app, a parent would have been able to see their
child's progress in school, their grades and attend meetings with the teachers etc.
